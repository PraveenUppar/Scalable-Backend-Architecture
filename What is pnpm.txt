pnpm is a fast, disk-space efficient package manager for JavaScript. 
While it works similarly to npm, it has a different approach to how it manages and stores your project's dependencies. 

npm's Approach (Flattened node_modules): 
- For years, npm has used a "flattened" dependency structure. This means it tries to put as many packages as possible into the top-level node_modules folder.
Disk Space: 
-If you have multiple projects that all use the same dependency (like React), npm will download and install a separate copy of that dependency for each project.

pnpm's Approach (Content-Addressable Storage)
- Global Store: It maintains a single, global store on your machine where it keeps every version of every package you've ever installed.
