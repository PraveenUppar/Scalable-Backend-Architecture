Why move from JavaScript to TypeScript?

The core reason for adopting TypeScript is to introduce static typing to your JavaScript code. 
- While JavaScript is a dynamically typed language (meaning you can change a variable's type at any time), 
- TypeScript is a "superset" of JavaScript that adds optional static types.
- Catch Bugs Early (Static Type Checking)
- Improved Code Quality and Readability
- Easier Maintenance for Large Projects
